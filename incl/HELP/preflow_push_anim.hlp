\bf\blue The Generic Preflow-Push Algorithm\rm\black

This demo illustrates the generic preflow push algorithm by A. Goldberg 
and R. Tarjan for computing a \bf maximum flow \rm in a network.

First you should construct a maxflow problem by drawing a 
graph between the source node \bf s\rm and the sink node \bf t\rm
 - every edge will get a random capacity.

Then press \bf done \rm and follow the instructions given at 
the top of the window.
