\bf Polygon Triangulation\rm 

This demo shows the result of the polygon triangulation algorithm.
You can draw and edit a counter-clockwise oriented simple polygon.
The output is a planar embedded graph whose edges are partitioned into
three categories:\\n\\n
- edges of the outer triangulation (grey)\\n
- edges of the inner triangulation (red)\\n
- polygon edges (black)
