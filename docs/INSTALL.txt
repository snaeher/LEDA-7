I. DIRECTORY OVERVIEW:
----------------------

   The LEDA main directory should contain the following files and 
   subdirectories: 

   LICENSE.pdf               license notice

   docs/README.txt           overview of LEDA documentation
   docs/CHANGES.txt          most recent changes
   docs/FIXES.txt            fixes since last release

   lconfig                   configuration command for unix
   lconfig.bat               configuration command for MS Windows
   Makefile                  main make script
   config/                   configuration directory
   incl/                     include directory
   src/                      source code files 
   demo/                     demo programs
   test/                     test programs
   app/                      apps



II. CONFIGURATION FOR UNIX 
--------------------------

1. Dependencies
   The following packages must be installed:
   libX11-dev
   libxft-dev
   yasm

2. Go to the LEDA main directory

3. Type: lconfig <cc>  [static | shared]

    where <cc> is the name (or command) of your C++ compiler
    and the optional second parameter defines the kind of 
    libraries to be generated (static or shared). 

    Examples: lconfig g++, lconfig g++ shared
     
    lconfig without arguments prints a list of known compilers.
    If your compiler is not in the list you might have to
    edit the <LEDA/sys/unix.h> header file.
    
    If you're installing on a windows machine, please read the 
    following sections.



III. Compilation on UNIX 
-----------------------------

Type make for building the object code library
libleda.a and libleda.so (if the shared library is used) 

Now follow the instructions given in File Install/unix.txt. 



IV. Configuration for MS Visual C++ under Windows
-------------------------------------------------

1. Dependencies
   The yasm-assembler (yasm.exe) must be installed
   (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/yasm)

2. Setting the Environment Variables for Visual C++: 
   The compiler CL.EXE and the linker LINK.EXE require that the 
   environment variables PATH, INCLUDE, and LIB have been set properly. 
   When Visual C++ was installed, setup created a batch file, 
   VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT containing the commands to modify 
   PATH, LIB, and INCLUDE. Run VCVARS32.BAT (VSVARS32.BAT) before you 
   compile LEDA as follows. 
   (a) At the command prompt, change to the \bin subdirectory of your 
   Visual C++ installation 
   ( ,e.g., c:\programs\microsoft visual studio\vc98\bin). 
   (b) Type VCVARS32 (VSVARS32). 
   
3. Add the the location of the yasm assembler to your PATH variable

4. Go to the LEDA main directory (at the command prompt used above). 

5. Type: lconfig msc [dll] [mt] 




V. Compilation with MS Visual C++ 
---------------------------------------

Type "build lib" for building the object code libraries 

static:  leda.lib
dynamic: leda.lib and leda.dll
