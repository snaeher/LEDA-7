\chapter{Miscellaneous} \label{Miscellaneous}

This section describes some additional useful data types, functions and
macros of LEDA. 
The stream data types described in this section are all derived from
the \CC stream types $istream$ and $ostream$. They can be used in any 
program that includes the $<$LEDA/stream.h$>$ header file. Some of these types 
may be obsolete in combination with the latest versions of the 
standard \CC I/O library.
