\chapter{Alignment Data Types} 
\label{AlignmentTypes}\label{Alignment}

This section describes several data types being used in the area of bioinformatics.
The data types $alphabet$ and $score\_matrix$ are just ingredients needed for the $alignment$
type. $distance$, $string\_matching$, and $alignment$ are classes providing comparison and
alignment functionality for a pair of strings. This chapter should be considered as the beginning
of a new module. Users are encouraged to send there expectations with respect to future functionality
to support@algorithmic-solutions.com.
