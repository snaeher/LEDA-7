\label{The Commercial Version}

Users of the LEDA research version 
may  notice that compared to the commercial version
it contains additional data types, algorithms or other features which are 

\begin{itemize}
\item
experimental (not tested enough or not working on all platforms)
\item
of interest only for particular research
\item
temporary (may be removed or changed in future versions)
\end{itemize}

The commercial version  will never (officially) contain data types, algorithms or 
features of this kind. Its official part is supposed to stay backward consistent in 
the sense that old programs should work with new versions of LEDA. 

\bigskip\noindent
Nevertheless, in order to provide as much functionality as possible, some of the
research types and features mentioned above are also contained in this package. 

\bigskip\noindent
Currently such types (among others) are:

\begin{itemize}

\item
$real$, the algebraic real numbers.

\item
$integer\_vector$ and $integer\_matrix$.

\item
$dynamic\_trees$ and $dynamic\_collection\_of\_trees$.

\item
The graph iterators given in $graph\_iterator.h$.

\item
The complete chapter on 3-dimensional data types.

\item
$graphwin$, the graph windows.
\end{itemize}
