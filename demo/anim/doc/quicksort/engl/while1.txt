In the first inner \tt while-\rm loop the left pointer \tt\blue2 i \rm\black moves to the right as long as the
keys \tt A[i] \rm are smaller than \tt\red v \rm\black .

In case \tt\red v \rm\black is the largest element in the interval, the loop is finished if the right
boundary of the interval is reached by \tt\blue2 i.
